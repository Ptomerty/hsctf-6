Hey there! This challenge is a quick introduction to netcat and how to use it. Netcat is a program that will help you "talk" with many of our challenges, especially pwn and misc. To begin, Windows users should download this file: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z8MS8SZYqZrteXOVPRL7BHwB4JL9t9J8

Extract the file, then open a command prompt and navigate to the directory using `cd <download-directory>`. From there, you can run `nc misc.hsctf.com 1111` to get your first flag.

Have fun!
