# Broken GPS

Ella is following a broken GPS. Every time she is supposed to move left, she ends up moving right, and vice versa. Every time she is supposed to move up, she moves down and vice versa. Eventually she ends up in a totally different place than her intended location. What is the shortest distance between these two points? Assume that she moves one unit every time a direction is specified.

# Input Format:
You will receive a text file with N directions (1<N<1000). The first line in the file will be N, and each consequent line will contain a single direction: “north,” “south,” “east,” “west,” “northwest,” “northeast,” “southwest,” or “southeast.” 

# Output Format:
Round your answer to the nearest whole number and then divide by 26. Discard the quotient (mod 26). Each possible remainder corresponds to a letter in the alphabet. (0=a, 1=b… 25=z). 

Find the letter for each test case and string them together. The result is the flag. (For instance, a, b, c becomes “abc”). Remember to use the flag format and keep all letters lowercase!
