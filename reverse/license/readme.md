Description: Keith made a cool license-checking program but he forgot the flag
he used to create the key! To make matters worse, he lost the source code and
stripped the binary for his license-generator program. Can you help Keith recover
his flag? All he knows is:

* The license key is 4-EZF2M-7O5F4-V9P7O-EVFDP-E4VDO-O
* He put his name (in the form of 'k3ith') as the first part of the flag
* There are 3 underscores
* The flag is in the format hsctf{}

Recommended points: 150 - 200
