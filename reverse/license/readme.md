Description: Keith made this cool license-checking program but he forgot the flag!
To make matters worse, he lost the source code and  the binary. Can you help
Keith recover his flag? All he knows is:

* The license key is 4-EZF2M-7O5F4-V9P7O-EVFDP-E4VDO-O
* He put his name (in the form of 'k3ith') as the first part of the flag
* There are 3 underscores
* The flag is in the format hsctf{}

Recommended points: 150 - 200
