Description: I found this cool license key checking program on the Internet but I'm bad at RE so can you help? The clues given are:

* The correct key is in the format: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
* The correct key only contains uppercase characters from A to Z, 0 to 9, and dashes between every five characters.
* One of the groups is '2BB93'.

Recommended points: 200 - 250ish
